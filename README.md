# Portfolio Risk Clustering & Anomaly Detection

Uncovering hidden asset relationships and surfacing abnormal risk behavior using unsupervised machine learning.

---

## Project Overview

This project explores patterns of financial risk by analyzing stocks from the **S&P 500** and **FTSE 100** indices.  
Using dimensionality reduction and unsupervised clustering techniques, we group stocks based on volatility, correlation, and other statistical properties and detect outliers with unusual behavior.

The goal: provide insights for portfolio construction, risk management, and anomaly detection.

## Core Methods

- **Feature Engineering**: returns, volatility, drawdowns, skewness, kurtosis, Sharpe ratio, correlation
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA, UMAP
- **Clustering**: HDBSCAN
- **Anomaly Detection**: HDBSCAN outliers flagged for further analysis
- **Visualizations**: cluster maps, anomaly overlays, Sharpe ratio gradients

## Pipeline Summary

### Phase 1 – Data Collection & Cleaning
- Retrieved 5-year OHLCV data for S&P 500 and FTSE 100 via `yfinance`
- Forward-filled missing values
- Aligned all time series data

### Phase 2 – Feature Engineering
- Calculated log returns, 30-day rolling volatility, drawdowns, correlation, skewness, kurtosis, and Sharpe ratios
- Constructed summary DataFrames for each asset

### Phase 3 – Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering
- PCA applied for linear inspection
- UMAP applied for non-linear projection (n_neighbors=5, min_dist=0.3)
- HDBSCAN used to reveal clusters and outliers
- Visualized clusters with Sharpe ratio overlays and labeled tickers

### Phase 4 – Insights & Outlier Detection
- Identified clusters of high-volatility or negative Sharpe assets
- Isolated HDBSCAN outliers for anomaly labeling
- Compared S&P 500 vs FTSE 100 risk behavior
- Derived conclusions on risk concentration and market dynamics

---

## Key Insights

### S&P 500
- Formed ~4-5 clusters of similar risk profiles
- Several outliers displayed abnormal volatility or highly negative Sharpe ratios (e.g., specific tech or biotech stocks)

### FTSE 100
- Showed more conservative clustering with tighter Sharpe ratios
- Outliers were mostly isolated financial or commodity-linked companies
- Stronger presence of high-kurtosis assets

---

## (Optional Enhancements)

- Add **Isolation Forest** or **Elliptic Envelope** for statistical anomaly detection
- Deploy **interactive Streamlit dashboard**
- Add **macroeconomic overlays** (e.g., VIX, CPI) for anomaly context
